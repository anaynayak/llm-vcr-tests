        that makes it easy to write and run tests for your code. It's popular for
        several reasons:\\n\\n\u2022 Simple Syntax: Writing tests with pytest often
        involves just writing regular Python functions whose names start with \\\"test_\\\".
        This simplicity makes tests easy to read and write.\\n\\n\u2022 Automatic
        Test Discovery: pytest automatically finds test files and functions in your
        project, so you don't need to manually specify which tests to run.\\n\\n\u2022
        Powerful Fixtures: Fixtures in pytest allow you to set up and tear down test
        environments, making it easier to manage resources like temporary files, database
        connections, or shared objects that may need to be prepared before tests run.\\n\\n\u2022
        Parameterized Testing: You can use parameterized tests to run the same test
        function with different input values, reducing code duplication and improving
        test coverage.\\n\\n\u2022 Rich Plugin Ecosystem: pytest has a large ecosystem
        of plugins that add functionality like parallel test execution, code coverage
        reporting, and integration with other tools.\\n\\nOverall, pytest is designed
        to be flexible and scalable, making it suitable for both small projects and
        large, complex codebases.\",\n        \"refusal\": null\n      },\n      \"finish_reason\":
